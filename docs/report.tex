\section{Goal}
The goal of this project is to design and build a system that collects transactions from recyclingstations and puts them in a database. Also to build a website which can display data that would be relevant for a user of the system.

\section{Design}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{ClassDiagram.png}

This design is built in such way that it can be scaled and later be replaced or work in conjunction with something written a completely different programming language. This is why there is a queue in between the soapservice and the database worker.

\section{Interfaces}
\subsection{soap}
Because of this interfaces or kept generic or text based (encoded in UTF-8). To deliver something to the soap interface you can either deliver the whole string at once via the addTransactiontext operation of course there is a specific format that should be followed. The format is: "<userID:UUID>, <locationID:UUID> , <timestamp:long> , <paper:int>, <plastic:int>, <glas:int>, <metal:int>". It can also be send in separate parts. The setup is similar but all the parts are separate in the soap message.
\subsection{RabbitMQ}
The RabbitMQ listener expects that all incoming data is a single string encoded in UTF-8. It's expects the data in the format as the string interface of soap.
